Mission Temple Fireworks Stand is the fifteenth studio album by the American country music band Sawyer Brown. Their first studio album since Can You Hear Me Now three years previous, it produced three singles. The first of these, which was the title track, was a collaboration with Robert Randolph. Following it was "They Don't Understand", which in late 2005 became the band's first Top 40 country hit since "800 Pound Jesus" in 2000. "They Don't Understand" was also a Top 15 on the Hot Christian Songs charts. A cover of The Georgia Satellites' "Keep Your Hands to Yourself", the third single from this album, failed to chart.
