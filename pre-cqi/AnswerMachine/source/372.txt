The 2022 Beef. It's What's for Dinner. 300 was the first stock car race of the 2022 NASCAR Xfinity Series and the 41st iteration of the event. The race was held on Saturday, February 19, 2022, in Daytona Beach, Florida at Daytona International Speedway, a 2.5 miles (4.0 km) permanent triangular-shaped superspeedway. The race was run over 120 laps. In a wild ending, Austin Hill, driving for Richard Childress Racing, would win the race under caution, with a major wreck including Jordan Anderson Racing driver Myatt Snider flipping and hitting the catchfence with others involved spinning and hitting parts of Snider's wrecked car. Snider would eventually walk away, unharmed from the incident. The win was Hill's first career NASCAR Xfinity Series win and his first of the season. To fill out the podium, A. J. Allmendinger of Kaulig Racing and Noah Gragson of JR Motorsports would finish second and third, respectively.
