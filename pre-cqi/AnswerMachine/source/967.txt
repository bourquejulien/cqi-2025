The women's light flyweight competition of the boxing events at the 2022 Mediterranean Games in Oran, Algeria, was held from 28 June to 1 July at the EMEC Hall.
Like all Mediterranean Games boxing events, the competition was a straight single-elimination tournament. Both semifinal losers were awarded bronze medals, so no boxers competed again after their first loss.
