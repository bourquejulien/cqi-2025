Tokyo is the most populated of Japan's 47 prefectures. As of June 2024, there are over 190 buildings and structures in Tokyo that stand at least 150 metres tall (492 feet), of which 43 are at least 200 metres tall (656 feet). The tallest structure in the prefecture is Tokyo Skytree, a megatall lattice tower that rises 634 metres (2,080 feet), which was completed in 2012. It also stands as the tallest structure in Japan, the tallest tower in the world and the third-tallest freestanding structure in the world. Tokyo Tower, a lattice tower completed in 1958, is the second-tallest structure in the prefecture and country, rising 333 metres (1,092 feet). The tallest building and third-tallest overall structure in Tokyo is the 325-metre-tall (1,067 feet) Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower in the Azabudai Hills development, completed in 2023 and being Tokyo's only supertall skyscraper. It is also the tallest building in Japan and the world's largest skyscraper by floor area. The second-tallest building in Tokyo is the 266-metre-tall (872 feet) Toranomon Hills Station Tower in the Toranomon Hills complex, which was completed in 2023. The prefecture's third-tallest building is the Toranomon Hills Mori Tower, also in the Toranomon Hills complex, which was completed in 2014 and rises 256 metres (838 feet) in height. Overall, as of June 2024, 17 of Japan's 25 tallest buildings and structures are in Tokyo.
Skyscrapers are a relatively recent phenomenon in Japan. Due to aesthetic and engineering concerns, Japan's Building Standard Law set an absolute height limit of 31 metres until 1963, when the limit was abolished in favor of a floor area ratio limit. Following these changes in building regulations, the Kasumigaseki Building was constructed and completed in 1968. Double the height of Japan's previous tallest building—the 17-story Hotel New Otani Tokyo—the Kasumigaseki Building is regarded as Japan's first modern high-rise building, rising 36 stories and 156 metres (512 feet) in height. A booming post-war Japanese economy and the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics helped lead to a building boom in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. Construction continued through the 1980s and 1990s as the Japanese asset price bubble rose and fell. Mainland Tokyo is divided into two sections: Western Tokyo and the special wards of Tokyo. All of the prefecture's tallest buildings are within the 23 special wards, which comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. Nishi-Shinjuku, a district within Shinjuku, was the prefecture's first major skyscraper development area. Starting with the construction of the Keio Plaza Hotel in 1971, the district is now home to 11 of Tokyo's 50 tallest skyscrapers. Other major skyscraper districts have since been developed, such as the ones around Tokyo Station, Shiodome, Toranomon, and Shibuya Station.
Tokyo has been the site of many skyscraper construction projects in recent years. Over the past decade, 15 buildings rising higher than 200 metres have been completed, of which 5 were completed in 2023. A total of 58 buildings standing at least 150 metres in height have been completed in Tokyo since 2014. As of June 2024, 29 skyscrapers are under construction in the prefecture, with 9 planned to rise higher than 200 metres, including a supertall skyscraper—the 385-metre-tall (1,263 feet) Torch Tower—which is set to become the new tallest building in Tokyo and Japan upon completion in 2028. Several other construction projects planned to exceed the height of 200 metres are proposed for the near future, as Tokyo is experiencing a "once-in-a-century" redevelopment boom.
