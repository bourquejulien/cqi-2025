Tri-Village High School is a public high school in New Madison, Ohio, the only one in the district. It is a consolidation of New Madison School District and the Westmont School District. The Tri-Village School District started with the 1972–73 school year. Prior to the consolidation between New Madison and Westmont to form Tri-Village, Westmont had been a consolidation between Hollansburg and Palestine. Due to community support for the school, it was renovated and expanded. The school is housed all on one campus. The school announced in 2015 that it will add football as a school sport.
