Verset laïque et somptueux (Secular and Sumptuous Verse) is a pièce d'occasion for piano composed in 1900 by Erik Satie. With it he bid an ironic farewell to the style of his "Rosicrucian" or "mystic" period, which he ultimately dismissed as "musique à genoux" ("music on its knees"). It was written for an ephemeral publication and never performed in Satie's lifetime.
