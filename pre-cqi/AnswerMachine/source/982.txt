The figure eight is a technique used by anglers to fish specifically for the muskellunge.   It has been developed due to the nature of the fish's hunting style. Essentially, the figure eight is a final enticement performed by the angler just before lifting the lure out of the water for another cast. To help visualize the concept, think of a roller coaster. As the lure is moved from side to side, it also moves up and down.
The figure eight is named after the pattern in which the angler pulls the lure through the water next to the boat in an attempt to get a following fish to bite. The muskellunge is known for “following” a lure up to the boat rather than immediately striking it. Anglers use different tactics to influence a following muskellunge into biting the bait, such as the figure eight. The figure eight has become a general term used for all boat-side tactics used to catch a following fish.  Other boat-side tactics used are "circles", "squares" (L-turns), and "dead sticking".
