Angel Arroyo Lanchas (born 2 August 1956 in El Barraco) is a Spanish former professional road bicycle racer. In the 1983 Tour de France, Arroyo won one stage and finished 2nd place in the general classification.
In stage 17 of the 1982 Vuelta a España, while leading the race, Arroyo was tested positive for Methylphenidate, and got a 10 minutes time penalty. This effectively stripped him of victory and put him back in 13th place.
