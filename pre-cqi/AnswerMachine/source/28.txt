The mayor of Blenheim officiated over the borough of Blenheim, New Zealand. The office was created in 1869 when Blenheim became a borough, and ceased with the 1989 local government reforms, when Blenheim Borough was amalgamated with Picton Borough and Marlborough County Council to form Marlborough District. There were 31 mayors of Blenheim. The last mayor of Blenheim, Leo McKendry, was elected as the first mayor of Marlborough.
