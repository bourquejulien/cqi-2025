Weiss Ferdl (28 June 1883 – 19 June 1949, real name: Ferdinand Weisheitinger) was a German actor, humorous folksinger, and author. He appeared in 19 films between 1928 and 1941 and performed regularly at the Platzl, a well-known Munich theater. Weiß Ferdl was born in the town of Altötting, 96 km (60 mi) east of Munich.
His famous song "Ein Wagen von der Linie Acht" ("A Carriage from Line 8") is still played to this day. It is a mocking song about Munich people and the trams in Munich. The Weiß-Ferdl-Mittelschule, a secondary school in Altötting, has a retired blue Munich Tram carriage in the southeast corner of the schoolyard.
