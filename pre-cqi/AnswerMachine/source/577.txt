The Greater Taree City Council (GTCC) was a local government area on the Mid North Coast of New South Wales, Australia, until 12 May 2016 when it was amalgamated to form part of the Mid-Coast Council.  It was originally formed in 1981 from the Manning Shire, and the Taree and Wingham Municipal Councils.  The council was centred on Taree, located adjacent to the Manning River, the Pacific Highway and the North Coast railway line.
The last serving mayor of GTCC was Cr. Paul Hogan, an unaligned politician.
