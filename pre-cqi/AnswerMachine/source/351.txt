Sapa () is a Nigerian slang term that has gained prominence in recent years, particularly among young Nigerians. It is used to describe a state of financial incapacity or extreme poverty, often resulting from excessive spending and poor financial management. It was eventually added to the Urban Dictionary in 2020.
