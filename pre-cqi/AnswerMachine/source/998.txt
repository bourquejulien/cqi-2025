The Sausage Factory, also known in the United States as MTV's Now What? or Much Ado About Whatever, is a teen sitcom that followed the lives of four friends in their junior year at West Boulder High School.
The four friends were Zack (Adam Brody), trying to win over his unrequited crush Lisa; Ted, the stereotypical rich kid who tries to consummate with his girlfriend, Nancy (Kristen Renton); J.C. (Kenny Fisher), who finds himself constantly approached by middle-aged women; and Gilby (Johnny Lewis), the class clown, who regularly creates trouble.
Produced in 2000 and 2001, it ran for one season. The single-camera series was shot without an audience and included no laugh track.
Originally aired in Canada on The Comedy Network, reruns were later screened on CTV and YTV. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, it airs on Trouble. Sky One previously aired it.
