Ferry Field is a multi-purpose stadium in Ann Arbor, Michigan. It opened in 1906 and was home to the Michigan Wolverines football team prior to the opening of Michigan Stadium in 1927. It had a capacity of 46,000. It is currently used as a tailgating space for football games.
After football moved to Michigan Stadium, Ferry Field was converted to an outdoor track and field facility and was still used for this purpose until 2018. In 1935, Ohio State sprinter Jesse Owens set world records in the 220 yard dash, the 200 meter dash, the 220 yard low hurdles, the 200 meter low hurdles, and the long jump, and tied the world record in the 100 yard dash, all within a 45-minute timespan. A bronze plaque at Ferry Field commemorates Owens' historic feat.
