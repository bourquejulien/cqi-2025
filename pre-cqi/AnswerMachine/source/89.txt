A Kimblewick, Kimberwicke or Kimberwick is a type of bit used on a horse, and named after the English town of Kimblewick where it was first made.  The bit has bit shanks, D-shaped rings, and a curb chain.  Due to its shanks, it is regarded as a type of curb bit.  The curb action is minimal to mild, however, because the shanks have short purchase arms and no lever arms (see Lever).  Some variations increase the curb action.  A Kimblewick is used with one set of reins.
