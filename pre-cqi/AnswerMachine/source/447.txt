La Tirana is an oil on canvas portrait by Francisco de Goya. Previously dated to 1799 due to a later pencil inscription, it is now dated to 1790–1792 by the Goya scholars José Gudiol and José Manuel Pita Andrade. It is now in the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.
It is the first of two portraits he produced of the actress María del Rosario Fernández, known as 'La Tirana' after her actor husband Francisco Castellanos, who was nicknamed el Tirano. The other is in a private collection.
