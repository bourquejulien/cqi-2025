The Holderness Free Library is the public library of Holderness, New Hampshire.  It is located at 866 US Route 3, at its junction with New Hampshire Route 113.   The architecturally eclectic building it presently occupies was built in 1909 to a design by Boston architects Fox & Gale, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.  It was the first purpose-built building for the library, which had occupied private homes and other facilities since its founding in 1893.
