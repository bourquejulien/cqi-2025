The Campeonato Brasileiro Série B (commonly referred to as the Brasileirão Série B (Série B), and currently officially called Brasileirão Série B Betnacional by sponsorship reasons) is the second tier of the Brazilian football league system. Although not having been played annually since its founding in 1971, the competition format has changed almost every season. Since 2006 it has been contested by 20 teams in a double round-robin format with the top four teams being promoted to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A group and the bottom four teams being relegated to the Campeonato Brasileiro Série C group.
