The 2018–19 season was Sport Lisboa e Benfica's 115th season in existence and the club's 85th consecutive season in the top flight of Portuguese football. It started with the UEFA Champions League third qualifying round on 7 August 2018 and concluded on 18 May 2019 with Benfica becoming Primeira Liga champions for a record 37th time.
Internationally, Benfica played in the Champions League group stage for the ninth successive time, a Portuguese record ranking fourth all-time. However, with two losses at Estádio da Luz, they set a domestic record of five consecutive home matches without a win in the competition. After finishing third in their group, they moved to the UEFA Europa League knockout phase, where they reached the quarter-finals.
