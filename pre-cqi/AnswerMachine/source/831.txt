The US Post Office-Quincy Main is a historic post office at 47 Washington Street in Quincy, Massachusetts.  It is a Classical Revival structure, two stories tall, built in 1909 out of limestone.  It has corner pilasters, and a central entry section that projects slightly, also with articulating pilasters, and three recessed entryways.  The building was originally built to house a variety of federal government offices, as well as providing the first purpose-built home for Quincy's main post office.
The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986.
