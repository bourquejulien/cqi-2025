Tribe of Force is the third album by German acapella metal band Van Canto.The album was released on 1 March 2010. This is the band's first release with Napalm Records.
The track listing features 13 tracks, two of them being covers ("Master of Puppets" by Metallica and "Rebellion" by Grave Digger), and three of them featuring guest artists: Victor Smolski (from Rage) guest appears in "One To Ten", Tony Kakko (from Sonata Arctica) guest appears on "Hearted" and Chris Boltendahl (from Grave Digger) guest appears in "Rebellion".
Two of this album's songs ("Water, Fire, Heaven, Earth" & "Hearted") have been, among Within Temptation's "Our Farewell", the inspiration for "Forevermore", a song by the Dutch symphonic metal band EPICA, featuring the mild-autistic Ruurd Woltring. The recording of this song was made possible thanks to the Dutch TV-show "Niks te gek!" (Nothing too crazy), in which mentally disabled people get their wishes granted.
