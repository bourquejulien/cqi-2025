The 2008 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 25th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2008 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on October 25, 2008 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California over a synthetic dirt surface.
Defending Horse of the Year Curlin was the odds-on favourite after winning several major races including the Dubai World Cup. However, he did not handle the track well and finished fourth, behind the American-bred but English-trained longshot Raven's Pass.
The Classic is run at a distance of one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m) with a purse of $5,000,000. It is normally run on a dirt surface but in 2008 was run over synthetic dirt. It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:

Northern Hemisphere three-year-olds: 122 lb
Southern Hemisphere three-year-olds: 117 lb
Four-year-olds and up: 126 lb
