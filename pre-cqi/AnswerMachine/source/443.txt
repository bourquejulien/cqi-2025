The following lists events that happened during 1995 in Afghanistan.
The Taliban bring a degree of calm to parts of Afghanistan, in part by neutralizing several powerful leaders and their supporters. The dispute over control of Kabul is not resolved, however, and regions of the country remain divided. Most ordinary Afghans, particularly in traditionally Pashtun areas of the country, welcome the sudden and effective success of the Taliban. Drug trafficking and lawlessness are targeted, and religious conformity is enforced. The latter includes severe restrictions on women's appearance in public and especially on their access to education and employment. Public executions and amputations are used to enforce Islamic behaviour. In northwestern Afghanistan Dostum continues to strengthen his independent position in Mazar-i-Sharif. With the destruction of Kabul, almost two-thirds of Afghanistan's total population is living in territory controlled by the Uzbek general. With a well-equipped army of 60,000, he continues to build economic and diplomatic relations with Afghanistan's neighbours. For Pakistan and Iran, Dostum's authority promises stable trade links to Central Asia, where he is seen as insurance against the threat of Islamic fundamentalism.
President Rabbani, whose extended term expired at the end of December, offers to relinquish power if an acceptable replacement could be found. Efforts by Mestiri and other UN mediators to bring the contending factions together and select a successor to Rabbani come to naught. The military-political situation is so unstable that serious negotiations are impossible.
