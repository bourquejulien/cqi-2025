State Route 788 (SR 788) is a north–south state highway in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Ohio.  The western terminus is at State Route 93 in Jackson.  Its eastern terminus is also at State Route 93, this time less than 2 miles (3.2 km) west of Wellston.
Created in the late 1930s, State Route 788 acts as a shortcut to avoid communities that State Route 93 passes through between Jackson and Wellston.
