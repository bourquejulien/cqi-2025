The Arthur and Ellen Colgan House, at 407 Third Street in Edgemont, South Dakota, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.
Photos show it is a two-and-a-half-story or three-story house.
The house has a wraparound porch and was built around 1900. Its architecture is said to reflect the then-ongoing transition between the Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styles.
The Colgans owned general merchandise stores in Oelrichs and in Edgemont.
