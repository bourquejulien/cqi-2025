Tapboard is the name of two separate guitar-based instruments that employ variations of the tapping technique. One of these is played by guitarist  Francis Dunnery and the other by bassist Balazs Szendofi. Unlike other tapping instruments such as the Chapman Stick, harpejji and Warr Guitar, both Tapboards are one-off custom designs and have never been produced commercially.
