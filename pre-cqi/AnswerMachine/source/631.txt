Impur II is an album by English guitarist, composer and improvisor Fred Frith. It was composed in 1996 by Frith and performed in December 1997 in RamDam in Lyon, France, by students and teachers from L’Ecole Nationale de Musique, Villeurbanne. Frith conducted and played with the ensemble.
Impur II is the second of two performances commissioned by L’Ecole Nationale de Musique while Frith was resident music professor at the institution. The first was Impur (2006), which was performed simultaneously by students in different rooms of a building. Frith did not play on that album. Impur II was an unannounced concert that took place in the school hall – 
it started with no audience and continued as people discovered it and began filling the room.
