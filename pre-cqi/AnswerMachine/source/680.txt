Bulletje en Boonestaak (later spelled Bulletje en Bonestaak) was one of the first very successful Dutch newspaper comic strips, the first Dutch comic moralists, and the first Dutch comic translated into other languages.
It ran from May 2, 1922 until November 17, 1937 in the Dutch papers Het Volk and Voorwaarts, drawn by the Flemish artist George Van Raemdonck, who had moved to the Netherlands as a war refugee in 1914, and Dutch writer A. M. de Jong.
The comic appeared in 1924 in German translation and in 1926 in French as well (Fil de Fer et Boule de Gomme). A Dutch comics award for contributions to the development of Dutch comics, the Bulletje en Boonestaak schaal is named after this comic.
