Crucifixion with the Virgin Mary, St John and St Mary Magdalene is a painting by the Flemish artist Anthony van Dyck. He produced it in 1617–1619 as the high altarpiece for the Jesuit church in Bergues, near Dunkirk, during his time as an assistant painter to Peter Paul Rubens—to whom the painting was long attributed. It was paid to Rubens in 1621 and seems to have been sold around 1746. It was bought by Louis XV of France in Antwerp in 1749 to be the high altarpiece of Saint-Louis de Versailles at the Palace of Versailles. It is now in the Louvre, in Paris.
