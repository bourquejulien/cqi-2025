Mechanical metamaterials are rationally designed artificial materials/structures of precision geometrical arrangements leading to unusual physical and mechanical properties. These unprecedented properties are often derived from their unique internal structures rather than the materials from which they are made. Inspiration for mechanical metamaterials design often comes from biological materials (such as honeycombs and cells), from molecular and crystalline unit cell structures as well as the artistic fields of origami and kirigami. While early mechanical metamaterials had regular repeats of simple unit cell structures, increasingly complex units and architectures are now being explored. Mechanical metamaterials can be seen as a counterpart to the rather well-known family of optical metamaterials and electromagnetic metamaterials. Mechanical properties, including elasticity, viscoelasticity, and thermoelasticity, are central to the design of mechanical metamaterials. They are often also referred to as elastic metamaterials or elastodynamic metamaterials. Their mechanical properties can be designed to have values that cannot be found in nature, such as negative stiffness, negative Poisson’s ratio, negative compressibility, and vanishing shear modulus.
