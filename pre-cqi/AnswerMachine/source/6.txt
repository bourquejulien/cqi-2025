Arrivo Corporation was a startup company in Los Angeles, California, that developed maglev rail. Arrivo initially attempted to commercialize a hyperloop, but abandoned the effort in November 2017 in favor of established transit technologies.
In November 2017, Arrivo proposed a plan for a 200 mph (322 km/h) maglev system in Colorado that would transport automobiles to and from Denver International Airport.
On December 14, 2018, Arrivo reportedly shut down due to being unable to secure Series A funding.
