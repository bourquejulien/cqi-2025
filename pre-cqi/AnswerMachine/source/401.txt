Girls Gone Wild  (GGW) was an adult entertainment franchise created by Joe Francis in 1997, who occasionally appears as the host of the videos.
Girls Gone Wild was known for its early use of direct-response marketing techniques, including its late-night infomercials that began airing in 1997. The videos typically involve camera crews at party locations engaging young college-aged women who expose their bodies or act "wild", especially during Spring break. Since 2008, the Girls Gone Wild products have been sold primarily through their website as streaming videos, downloads, and DVDs.
In February 2013, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.
In 2014, the company was sold to Bang Bros.
