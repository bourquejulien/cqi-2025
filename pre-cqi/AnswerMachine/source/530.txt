The 2013 No Surrender (also known as  Impact Wrestling: No Surrender) was the ninth No Surrender professional wrestling event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). It took place on September 12, 2013 at the Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis, Missouri. Unlike the previous events, this event was not held on pay-per-view (PPV) and instead, like Destination X and Hardcore Justice, was featured as a special edition of TNA's weekly broadcast of Impact Wrestling. 
Five matches were contested at the event including a pre-show match. The event concluded the 2013 Bound for Glory Series, as A.J. Styles defeated Magnus in the tournament final to earn himself a TNA World Heavyweight Championship match at Bound for Glory. Also at the event, Bully Ray successfully defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Mr. Anderson in a Last Man Standing match.
