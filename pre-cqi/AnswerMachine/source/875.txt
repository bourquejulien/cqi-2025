The Synod of Oxford was held on 9 May 1222, at Osney Abbey, in Oxford, England. It was a council of the (Catholic) church in England, convened by Archbishop Stephen Langton. It is notable for a number of the decisions taken and canon laws set.
During the Synod, "harsh anti-Jewish laws" were enacted: "social relations between Jews and Christians were blocked; church tithes were levied against Jews, and English Jews were forced to wear an identifying badge. The construction of new synagogues was also prevented." 
For many centuries, it was thought that the decision that Saint George's Day  should be celebrated as a holy day in England was made at this Synod. However, since the 1960s, this has been regarded by historians as an invention.
