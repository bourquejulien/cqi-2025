Headroom LGBTQ+ Lounge, also called simply Headroom, was a short-lived gay bar in Jersey City, New Jersey. It operated for six months, from November 2020 to May 2021. Though it was open only during the COVID-19 pandemic, the venue proved to be popular and offered an array of live entertainment, including drag shows, burlesque performances and RuPaul's Drag Race viewing parties. A contract dispute between the establishment's owners forced its abrupt closure days before the 2021 Memorial Day weekend. Critics praised the quality of Headroom's shows and noted its value as a safe space for the local LGBT community.
