Hepatopancreatic parvoviruses (HPV) are viruses with single-stranded DNA genomes that are in the family Parvoviridae, and which infect shrimp, prawn and other crustaceans. HPV infects the epithelial cells of the host's hepatopancreas and midgut, leading to stunted growth at the early life stage. For shrimp farms, especially in Asian countries such as China, India and Indonesia, HPV can lead to economic losses in aquaculture due to the reduced production.
