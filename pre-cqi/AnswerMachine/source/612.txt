In mathematics, a canonical basis is a basis of an algebraic structure that is canonical in a sense that depends on the precise context:

In a coordinate space, and more generally in a free module, it refers to the standard basis defined by the Kronecker delta.
In a polynomial ring, it refers to its standard basis given by the monomials, 
  
    
      
        (
        
          X
          
            i
          
        
        
          )
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle (X^{i})_{i}}
  
.
For finite extension fields, it means the polynomial basis.
In linear algebra, it refers to a set of n linearly independent generalized eigenvectors of an n×n matrix 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
  
, if the set is composed entirely of Jordan chains.
In representation theory, it refers to the basis of the quantum groups introduced by Lusztig.
