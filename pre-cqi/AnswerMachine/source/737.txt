"In My Mind" is the debut single by American singer-songwriter Maty Noyes, released on 8 July 2016, as the lead and only single from her debut EP Noyes Complaint. The song was written by Noyes and Norwegian songwriter William Wiik Larsen and produced by the duo as well.
Musically, "In My Mind" is a harmonic, retro-pop song which makes use of electric guitar and drum instrumentation. The vocals are backed by mildly synthesized beats.
The song has charted in Sweden, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic. An accompanying music video was released to Noyes's Vevo account on September 7, 2016, ahead of the EP's release. It features Noyes having mixed feelings about a lover in a bedroom, and singing the song while contemplating what to do. The video also features a flower theme: Noyes can be seen singing in a bed of flowers and in a bathtub surrounded by flowers that appear to be Rhododendrons. The video has achieved over 6 million views on YouTube/Vevo.
