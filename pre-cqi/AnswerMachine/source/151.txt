The Union Street Pedestrian Bridge is a bridge in Seattle, in the U.S. state of Washington. The bridge connects Western Avenue to the waterfront and replaces a metal staircase. The bridge, stairs and elevator opened in December 2022 following approximately two years of construction. The project features two artworks by local artist Norie Sato, including a screen wall and an approximately 37 foot tall steel sculpture inspired by a feather.
