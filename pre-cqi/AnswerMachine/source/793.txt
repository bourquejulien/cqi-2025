The 228 Hand-in-Hand rally was a demonstration in the form of a human chain held in Taiwan on February 28, 2004, the 57th anniversary of the February 28 Incident. Approximately two million (estimation ranged from 1.2 to 2.3 million depending on the reporting media) Taiwanese formed a 500-kilometer (310 mi) long human chain from Keelung to Pingtung County to commemorate the incident, to call for peace, and to protest the deployment of missiles by the People's Republic of China aimed at Taiwan along the coast. The rally was the largest in Taiwanese history.
