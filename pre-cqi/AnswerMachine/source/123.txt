There was a short lived attempt to quarry iron ore in the parish in the early 1860s. The quarry ceased operation by 1863. It was on the west side of the railway to the north of Northampton Station and the site is now built over or covered by railway sidings. It had a horse -worked tramway to take the ore to the railway.
Dallington is north-east of Duston, south of Kings Heath and north-west of St James End.
