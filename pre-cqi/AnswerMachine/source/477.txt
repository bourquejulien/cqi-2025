Little Harbour is a drive-through community of 13 families on South Twillingate Island, off the north shore of the Canadian island of Newfoundland. It is located approximately 3 km south of Twillingate on Route 340. Little Harbour is known for a scenic atmosphere and authentic small-town feel.
Little Harbour has several wharfs, which were used by fishermen years ago, as well as a historic church that is no longer regularly used and a trail that leads to Lower Little Harbour, which can be walked, biked or drove on using a 4x4 vehicle. One of the main attractions in Lower Little Harbour is the Natural Arch. Icebergs attract tourists to the Little Harbour and Twillingate area each year.
