The Kids Will Have Their Say is the debut album by the Boston hardcore punk band SS Decontrol.  The album was released in 1982 as a split-release between Dischord and X-Claim records (catalog numbers X-Claim 1/Dischord 7½).  The album was only pressed in 1,900 copies  and never re-pressed, making it quite a collector's item. However, a bootleg version was made in the late 1980s, but the label names on the back of the sleeves are switched to Discord and Ex-Claim, making it easy to separate from the original pressing.
The album was reissued in late 2023.
